In this guide we will be a Grails application with a Vue.js app as the frontend, using the https://grails-profiles.github.io/vue/latest/guide/index.html[Vue profile]. The example project will be the `Garage` application as seen in the http://guides.grails.org/building-a-react-app/guide/index.html[React] and http://guides.grails.org/vaadin-grails/guide/index.html[Vaadin] guides. You can refer to those guides for comparison with the Vue.js version.

Please note that this guide is not an introduction to Vue.js. You can refer to the https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/[official documentation], or see this https://objectcomputing.com/resources/publications/sett/january-2018-room-with-a-vue-part-1[introductory article].
