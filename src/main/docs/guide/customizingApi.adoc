By default, the RESTful URLs generated by Grails provide only the IDs of associated objects.

This is standard for many REST APIs, but we'll need to get a bit more data from this endpoint for our Vue app in a moment. This is an excellent scenario for http://views.grails.org/latest/[JSON Views]. Let's create a new JSON view to render our Vehicle list:

[source,bash]
----
$ mkdir grails-app/views/vehicle/
----

By convention, any JSON views in the corresponding view directory for a restful controller (like those generated by `@Resource`) will be used in lieu of the default JSON representation. Now we can customize our JSON output for each Vehicle by creating a new JSON template for Vehicle:

[source,bash]
----
$ vim grails-app/views/vehicle/_vehicle.gson
----

Edit the file to include the following:

[source,groovy]
.server/grails-app/views/vehicle/_vehicle.gson
----
include::{sourceDir}/server/grails-app/views/vehicle/_vehicle.gson[]
----

Now when we access our API, we'll see the `name` and `id` of each `make`, `model`, and `driver` are included.
