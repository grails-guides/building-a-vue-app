Now, when running our app, we can try out the RESTful API that Grails has generated for us.

[source,bash]
----
$ cd initial
$ ./gradlew server:bootRun
----

NOTE: If you wish to run the app using the Grails wrapper `./grailsw run-app` instead of Gradle make sure that
you are in your `server` directory when starting up the app or using a local installation of Grails 3.3.0.

Now we can exercise the API using cURL or another API tool.
