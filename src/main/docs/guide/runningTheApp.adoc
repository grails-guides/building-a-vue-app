The app in this guide uses the `vue` profile, which provides a multiproject client/server build. This
means you must start both the server (Grails) and client (Vue.js) apps independently.

[source,bash]
----
$ cd initial/
----

To launch the server application, run the following command.

[source,bash]
----
$ ./gradlew server:bootRun
----

This will start up the Grails application, which will be running on `http://localhost:8080`

To start the client app, open a second terminal session (in the same directory), and run the following command:


[source,bash]
----
$ ./gradlew client:bootRun
----

The Vue.js app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`. Browse to that URL and you should see the home page of the app.
